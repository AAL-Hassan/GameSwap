GameSwap is a simulated online video game store that was created utilising fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Payment processing is facilitated through the utilisation of the payment platform, Stripe. Users have the ability to select a specific game to view its product page and corresponding price. Upon selecting a game, users can proceed to click the purchase button, which subsequently redirects them to a Stripe checkout page for the selected product. in this current iteration, only the first game in the grid, Hogwarts Legacy, has a fully functioning store and checkout page. This was done just so I could test out a checkout system. Thank you for your Understanding
